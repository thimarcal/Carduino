 * CarHandler.hpp is a Handler for the commands received by the Android remote control
 *
 * Commands must be in the format of <direction-power> pairs.
 * There may up to 2 pairs at the same time, indicating that the car is going forward/backwards and turning in any direction.
 * Forward / Backward may not be handled at the same time.
 * Right / Left turns may not be handled at the sama time.
 *
 * e.g.
 * f-60:r-30
 * b-95:l-45
